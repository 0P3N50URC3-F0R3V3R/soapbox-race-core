# SBRW Core

## About/Overview
The **soapbox-race-core** project is focused on developing a game server compatible with the game **Need for Speed:
World**. Currently, most of the original game functionality is implemented, but development is still ongoing.

## Technical details
The server is an application built to run on the [Wildfly](https://wildfly.org) platform. Gradle is used as the build
system. All code is Java 8; no later and no earlier.

## Installation
Because installation is a bit of a lengthy process, please refer to the [Installation](https://github.com/SoapboxRaceWorld/soapbox-race-core/wiki/Installation) wiki page.
